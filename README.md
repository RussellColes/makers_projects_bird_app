# WELCOME TO THE BIRD APP (NAME TBD)

## Please run these (in the parent directory) to get started

```bash
chmod +x start.sh

./start.sh
```

This makes a venv if there isn't one and install all the backend and frontend dependencies/libraries. Might need to install Node Package Manager if prompted.
